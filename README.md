# Principal Agent

Uses Shiny (written in R) to make simple apps to let users experiment with simple economic principal-agent models.

I manually deploy the Shiny app to:
https://jeanimal.shinyapps.io/principal_agent/
(So the repo can get out of sync with the deployed app.)

# Tools

The app was created with RStudio, so just load the .Rproj file for easy development and running locally.

# Models

The models are based on the summaries in Laffont and Maritmort's 2001 _The Theory of Incentives_.
